- [Battle of Thermopylae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae)
        - The Greeks learned of the Persian invasion. They had data, and knew they were outnumbered and they were not prepared to fight head-on.
        - The odds were rather crazy. The Greek force was initially a few thousand, facing a Persian army of ~1 million men.
            - After the first couple of days, most of the army retreated and ~300 men, under the command of King Leonidas fought a rear guard action to protect their retreating comrades.
            - It was a suicide mission and they all knew it.
            - Yes, this is where the movie 300 comes from.
            - It was a bit more complicated IRL.
            - And the men probably had less glorious abs.
        - The Greeks fought a delaying action at a narrow pass called the Pass of Thermopylae while the Greek navy fought a simultaneous battle at the Straits of Artemisium.
        - The Greeks were defeated at Thermopylae, but it bought them enough time to defeat the Persians later at Marathon, a battle still celebrated today when we run marathons.
    - Oda Nobunaga's defeat of Yoshimoto at the "battle" Okehazama.
        - Facing a numerically superior force (~12:1), his scouts figured out that Yoshimoto had divided his army multiple times.
        - Yoshimoto was alone with a much smaller contingent, ~5,000 men. This was discovered by Nobunaga's scouts.
        - Nobunaga surprised Yoshimoto with a surprise attack, killing the general.
        - Although his army was relatively unscathed, Yoshimoto's army disintegrated, retreated, and Nobunaga would go on to unify Japan a few years later.
    - The Battle of Midway (Naval, WWII)
        - The Japanese military thought it could trick the US Navy into dividing it's forces by invading the Aleutian islands.
        - It didn't work, because the US Navy knew the plan and could decode many of their communications.
        - Sidebar: Did you know the invasion of the Aleutians is the only time an invading military has set foot on American soil since the war of 1812?
    - I mean, seriously, I could do this all night.
    - The point? Collecting data is not a modern idea.
