## What have we learned thus far?

- Data science is hard.
- Data is not always easy to work with.
- The shape of the data is rarely what we want.
    - But NOW we can change the shape/grain of the data.
    - We can combine it in new ways.
- We've done some data import, although I glossed over the details.
- We have done a lot of data transformation and some data visualization.

## Bias

- Biased data leads to biased analysis. And you can't fix this with a bootstrap.

## Accuracy/Precision

- Diagnosing depression is not like measuring the temperature of a chemical reaction.
    - The PHQ-9 is considered a gold-standard of mental health diagnosis and measurement.
    - Studies seeking to improve outcomes for people suffering from depression often use changes in PHQ-9 scores to assert effectiveness.

- In healthcare, social work, economics, government, and just plain studying of people, we often cannot peg objective reality.
    - I am NOT suggesting we should not study these things.
    - I am suggesting we should not treat these subjects as the mathematical equivalent of Boyle's Law.

- Who should we study/collect data on?
    - College students? (Hello, psychology)
    - Medicaid recipients? (Hello, NYS)
    - Nuns? (The Nun Study is a longitudinal study of 678 Catholic sisters 75 to 107 years of age who are members of the School Sisters of Notre Dame congregation.)
    - Members of the military?


## Unintended consequences - Pneumonia

- CMS, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services rate hospitals on a number of quality measures.
- One of these is 30 day mortality for pneumonia. 
    - What proportion of patient die 30 days after discharge from the hospital?
    - Patients must be Medicare Fee For Service (Managed Care is exempt) or be a VA beneficiary.
    - Patient must be 65 or older.
    - Discharged from non-federal acute care hospitals or VA hospitals.
    - Had to be alive on the day of discharge. (I'm not kidding, that's part of the spec.)

- There is some evidence that high performance may correlate with certain coding patterns.
    - Aspiration pneumonia is excluded from the CMS measure. https://www.healthline.com/health/aspiration-pneumonia
    - One study suggests hospitals that do well on the CMS pneumonia measure are more likely to code for aspiration pneumonia or respiratory failure.

## Unintended consequences - Foster Care (1/2)

There are federal quality guidelines for the state management of it's foster care program. Let's look at some of these measures. Broadly, child welfare outcomes for children and families focus on *safety, permanency, and well-being*. There are seven broad areas these outcomes cover

- Outcome 1: Reduce recurrence of child abuse and/or neglect
- Outcome 2: Reduce the incidence of child abuse and/or neglect in foster careOutcome
- Outcome 3: Increase permanency for children in foster care
- Outcome 4: Reduce time in foster care to reunification without increasing reentry
- Outcome 5: Reduce time in foster care to adoption
- Outcome 6: Increase placement stability
- Outcome 7: Reduce placements of young children in group homes or institutions

## Unintended consequences - Foster Care (2/2)

- Measure 6.1a: The percentage of children in foster care for less than 12 months who experienced two or fewer placement settings
- Measure 6.1b: The percentage of children in foster care for at least 12 months but less than 24 months who experienced two or fewer placement settings
- Measure 6.1c: The percentage of children in foster care for 24 months or longer who experienced two or fewer placement settings

I spent years working on this topic. And it is a great example of unintended consequences. States expend significant resources to maintain the first two placements.
