# Instructions

The goal of this midterm is to help me understand what you have
learned thus far in our time together. As with all other tasks in this
course, I am going to treat you like programmers, with a few
caveats. To complete the tasks in this exam, you may use the following:

- Any/all class lecture notes, labs, cheat sheets from RStudio, etc.
- The book for this class: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/
- Google (If you are really desperate, Bing.)
- Stack Overflow

However, I must require you to complete your own exam. You may not
help anyone else in this class and you may not accept help from anyone
else in the class.

If you have any questions, please ask me. Any clarifications I make
will be announced to the entire class.

The layout of the midterm is identical to the labs you have
completed. Complete the tasks below and answer the associated
questions in Canvas.



# SETUP

1. Create a folder called "Midterm".
2. Create a script, "No Shows.R" into that folder.
3. Copy/paste the following into RStudio. Replace `Your Name` with . . . . your name.
4. After running the code below, confirm that you have created a table
   called Appointments. It should contain:
    - 110,527 rows
    - 15 columns

```{r}
## Your Name
## Midterm - No Shows


## INIT ========================================================================
library(tidyverse)

## For large/small numbers, R likes to use scientific notation. This makes the
## numbers easier to read. None of these numbers warrant scientific notation.
options(scipen = 999)

## DATA ========================================================================
appointments_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intro-to-data/Data/master/Appointments.csv"
Appointments <- read_csv(appointments_url)
head(Appointments)
```

Remember, you must load your packages (`tidyverse`, etc.) and data for
EACH session in R. Just beause you had the `tidyverse` loaded last
time means nothing for the current session.

**Hint:** Run all of the preceding code.



# Appointments

A no-show appointment occurs when a patient makes an appointment with
their doctor, receives all of the instructions, and does not come to
their appointment. Understanding the likelihood of a patient skipping
their appointment is helpful for providers and their staff.

Although this data set is specific to Brazil and is taken from Kaggle,
this is a very real problem we work on here in the Capital
District. With that said, this data is specific to the context from
which it was collected. Do not assume the patterns seen in this data
are necessarily true here. Context matters.

https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments

**Grain:** Each row of data is a _single appointment_. A patient may
have more than one appointment. (Many do.)

## Data Dictionary

- PatientId: Unique identifier for that patient.
- AppointmentID: Unique identifier for each appointment
- Gender: Male (M) or Female (F).
- AppointmentDate: The Date (YYYY-MM-DD) of the appointment
- AppointmentDay: An abbreviation of the name of the day of the
  appointment (Mon, Tue, etc.)
- AppointmentMonth: The abbreviation of the name of the month of the
  appointment.
- Age: Patient age, on the day of the appointment, in years.
- Neighbourhood: Where the appointment takes place.
- Scholarship: TRUE or FALSE 
    - For more detail:
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia
- Hipertension: Does the patient have hypertension? TRUE or FALSE
    - Note the unusual spelling of this column.
- Diabetes: Does the patient have diabetes? TRUE or FALSE
- Alcoholism: Does the patient have diabetes? TRUE or FALSE
- Handcap: Does the patient have a handicap? TRUE or FALSE
    - Note the unusual spelling of this column.
- ReceivedSMS: Did the patient receive a SMS? TRUE or FALSE
- NoShow: Did the patient no-show? TRUE or FALSE
    - **Hint:** R treats Boolean TRUE values as equal to 1 and FALSE
      values as equal to 0. You can sum a column of TRUE/FALSE values
      to get the count of TRUE.

# Tasks

## Task 01: How Many No-Shows?

- How many appointments were recorded as a no-show?
- When you create a new column via summarize, I recommend you give it
  a name, so you can later sort it, call it, etc. In this case,
  calling the `sum()` `N` seems appropriate.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 01: How Many No-Shows?
Appointments %>%
    summarize()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Task 01: How Many No-Shows?
Appointments %>%
    summarize(N = sum(NoShow))
```


## Task 02: No-Shows by Neighbourhood?

- Which neighbourhood had the most no-shows?
- **Hint:** Spelling matters.
- You can use your code from Task 01 to help you.
- You can thank me now for recommending you name the sum of NoShow.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 02: No-Shows by Neighbourhood?
Appointments %>%
    group_by() %>%
    summarize() %>%
    arrange()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Task 02: No-Shows by Neighbourhood?
Appointments %>%
    group_by(Neighbourhood) %>%
    summarize(N = sum(NoShow)) %>%
    arrange(desc(N))
```


## Task 03: 822145925426128

- How many appointments did 822145925426128 (`PatientID`) have?
- How many no-shows did 822145925426128 have?
- You can do this in a sngle code chunk, but if you do it in two and
  get the right answers, you will get full credit.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 03: 822145925426128
Appointments %>%
    filter()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Task 03: 822145925426128
Appointments %>%
    filter(PatientID == 822145925426128) %>%
    summarize(N = n(),
              NS = sum(NoShow))
```


## Task 04: No-Shows For Patients Over 50

- How many no-shows were recorded by patients over the age of 50?

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 04: No-Shows For Patients Over 50

```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Task 04: No-Shows For Patients Over 50
Appointments %>%
    filter(Age > 50) %>%
    summarize(N = sum(NoShow))
```



## Task 05: Average Age NoShow

- What is the average age of a no-show patient?
- What is the standard deviation of the age of a no-show patient (`sd()`)?
- You can complete this task with a single code chunk, but if you use
  two and get the right answers, you will get full credit.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 05: Average Age NoShow

```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Task 05: Average Age NoShow
Appointments %>%
    group_by(NoShow) %>%
    summarize(AvgAge = mean(Age), StdDevAge = sd(Age))
```

## Task 06: ReceivedSMS

- One popular intervention for no-shows is to call patients before
  their appointment, to remind them of their upcoming appointment.
- In `Appointments` we have a column called `ReceivedSMS`. Where
  `TRUE`, these patients received a text message reminding them of
  their upcoming appointment.
- Who had a higher no-show rate?
    - ReceivedSMS == TRUE
    - ReceivedSMS == FALSE
- To answer this question, you will need to group by `ReceivedSMS` and
  then calculate the rate of no-shows for each group. This is similar
  to something we did in a recent lab.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 06: ReceivedSMS
Appointments %>%
    group_by() %>%
    summarize() %>%
    mutate()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Task 06: ReceivedSMS
Appointments %>%
    group_by(ReceivedSMS) %>%
    summarize(N = sum(NoShow), D = n()) %>%
    mutate(R = N/D*1000)
```

## Task 07: Chronic Conditions
- Create a new table, called `NoShowRate` which compares the no-show
  rate of two groups.
    - Use this to compare the no-show rate of patients with/without
      hypertension and diabetes.
- Create a bar plot (`geom_col()`) comparing the rate of no-shows per
  1,000 appointments.
- Create a separate plot for those with/without hypertension and
  with/without diabetes.
- Please upload the diabetes plot.
    - Remember, you can export a plot from RStudio.
- Compared to the rest of the population, how would you describe the
  no-show rate of patients with these chronic conditions?
    - Higher no-show rate
    - Lower no-show rate
    - Similar no-show rate

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 07: Chronic Conditions
##Hint: Name your results in both summarize and
## mutate so you can use them as variables later.
NoShowRate <-
    Appointments %>%
    group_by() %>%
    summarize() %>%
    mutate()

## geom_col expects a defined column for x and y.
ggplot(NoShowRate, aes()) + geom_col()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Task 07: Chronic Conditions
NoShowRate <-
    Appointments %>%
    group_by(Diabetes) %>%
    summarize(N = sum(NoShow), D = n()) %>%
    mutate(R = N/D*1000)

## geom_col expects a defined column for x and y.
ggplot(NoShowRate, aes(Diabetes, R)) + geom_col(fill = "blue")
```


## Task 08: Distribution of No-Shows

- Create a new table, called `NoShowCounts`.
- The `Appointments` table is at the appointment grain.
- This new table, `NoShowCounts`, should be at the patient grain. This
  means each row in `NoShowCounts` should be a single patient and no
  patient should duplicate.
- Create a histogram showing the distribution of no-show appointments.
    - Upload your histogram of no-shows.
- How many distinct patients are in your `NoShowCounts` table?
    - If you made your table right, this should be the number of rows
      in your `NoShowCounts` table.
- How would you describe the distribution of no-shows?
    - Normally distributed
    - Skewed

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 08: Distribution of No-Shows
NoShowCounts <-
    Appointments

ggplot(NoShowCounts, aes()) +
    geom_histogram()
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
NoShowCounts <-
    Appointments %>%
    group_by(PatientID) %>%
    summarize(n = sum(NoShow))

ggplot(NoShowCounts, aes(n)) +
    geom_histogram()

## Two ways to calculate
dim(NoShowCounts)
Appointments %>% select(PatientID) %>% distinct() %>% count()
```


## Task 09: New Column Over50

- Create a column which identifies patients who are over 50 years old.
- Call this new column `Over50`. (Use `mutate()`)
- This column should contain TRUE/FALSE values for each
  appointment. In other words, this new column goes into the
  `Appointments` table, not a new table.
- How would you describe the no-show rate of patients over 50 compared to other patients?
    - Higher
    - Lower
    - About the same
- Once you have created your new column, this is very similar to Task
  07.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 09: New Column Over50
## There's no code stub, but your code
## should create a new copy of Appointments.

```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Task 09: New Column Over50
Appointments <-
    Appointments %>%
    mutate(Over50 = Age > 50)

Appointments %>%
    group_by(Over50) %>%
    summarize(N = sum(NoShow), D = n()) %>%
    mutate(R = N/D*1000)

```


## Task 10: Upload your code

- Upload your .R file.
- Please and thank you.
- Have a great spring break.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Task 10: Upload your code
## You don't really need to write any code here.
```
